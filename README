I've been using LaTeX in anger for more than 20 years.  For most of that time, I've been
copying and pasting macros from the last-written paper to whichever one I'm currently
working on.  This is barely adequate when I don't have coauthors, much less when I do.

The main purpose of this repository is to organize and document this tangle of
macros, so my coauthors will be happier.  If you're not one of my coauthors, and you
find (some of) this useful, so much the better.

* jdunfield.sty: A semi-organized pack of wild macros (previously joshuadunfield.sty).

* goodcharter.sty: Use Bitstream Charter as the main font without making it
  impossible to use bold CM sans serif (as the charter.sty package does,
  for reasons I don't understand).

* etal.sty: Macros for "et al." and similar abbreviations with correct spelling,
  punctuation, and spacing.

* llproof.sty: Provides an environment `llproof' for line-by-line proofs.

* rulelinks.sty: Macros for inference rule names that hyperlink back to where the
  rule was defined.

* purple.cls: A more colourful article class.  I use this for lecture notes.

* mathpartir.sty: Didier Rémy's inference rules package.  I didn't write this,
  and I don't recall modifying it, but I've learned through hard
  experience *never* to assume that a different version of a package
  will work, so I'm including it here.

* example.tex: Example, currently only showing the "rules" class.

* friendlyappendix.sty: Macros for structuring an appendix of omitted proofs in
  conjunction with the "restatable" environment.

* friendly-example.tex: An example of using friendlyappendix.sty.
